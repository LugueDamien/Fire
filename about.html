                <h2><b>History</b></h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Understanding the history of fire prevention is critical to appreciate how far we have come in terms of fire safety and prevention. Fire prevention efforts date back centuries, with various societies developing their approaches to combating fires.
                </p>
                <p>
                In ancient Rome, for example, fire brigades were established to respond to fire emergencies. In the 17th century, the Great Fire of London prompted the development of fire insurance and the installation of fire hydrants. In the 19th century, the industrial revolution led to a significant increase in fires, resulting in the formation of the first professional firefighting organizations.
